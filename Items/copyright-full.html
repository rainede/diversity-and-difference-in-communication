                    We believe the primary barrier to accessing high-quality educational experiences is cost, which is why we aim to publish as much free content as possible under an open licence. If it proves difficult to release content under our preferred Creative Commons licence (e.g. because we can’t afford or gain the clearances or find suitable alternatives), we will still release the materials for free under a personal end-user licence. 
                    This is because the learning experience will always be the same high quality offering and that should always be seen as positive – even if at times the licensing is different to Creative Commons.

The benefit of this is so that we can continue to gather the information that is needed to improve OER and help exploit the openness of OER.  By tracking it also will assist with enhancing brand awareness due to the value of providing OER, as the ability to track where the OER is used potentially will provide valuable information about who and where our OER content is being used.</p><p>
Track OER is software that tracks Open Educational Resources, gathering data on HTML packaged content that is downloaded from OpenLearn and OpenLearn Works. <br/>
